# Small-Banking-System
 This small banking system includes six functions : 
 1.Add Acccount
 2.Read Account
 3.Update Account
 4.Delete Account
 5.Print Account
 6.Exit
 If you don't add any account, you won't be allowed to use all these services except 1 and 6.
 It will check not to have account that has similar ID. So, there won't be any account that are similar in names.
 The whole system is completely based on ID you create.Thanks!
